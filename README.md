Create a bar chart or histogram to visualize the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable, such as the distribution of ages or genders in a population.

Visualizing Data Distribution
To effectively understand the distribution of variables in dataset, visualization plays a crucial role. 

Bar Chart for Categorical Variables
A bar chart is suitable for visualizing the distribution of categorical variables. It displays the frequency or count of each category as bars, making it easy to compare different categories visually.

Histogram for Continuous Variables
For continuous variables like ages or income levels, histograms are commonly used. Histograms display the distribution of data by dividing it into bins and showing the frequency of observations in each bin. This allows us to see patterns such as central tendency, dispersion, and skewness in the data.
